# U.S. Baby Names Analysis

### Project Overview 
This project explores baby names from U.S. Social Security card applications over three decades. Using SQL, I analyzed trends in name popularity by year, state, and gender, uncovering patterns and insights into naming conventions across the United States.

### Analysis Questions
What were the most popular baby names of each decade? How does this change over time?

Which baby names had the biggest jumps and drops in popularity?

Are there differences in which names are given to boys vs girls vs both over time?

Are there differences in baby name popularity based on the region in the United States?
